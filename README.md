#program 1

* In this Python Program we uses the full name function.
* And we prints the statements to prompt the input from the user as firstname and lastname
* By that based on the function we joins both firstname and lastname we prints the entire fullname.
* And by using the string alternative function we prints the alternate characters in the fullname.
* By using the for loop we compares the index value of each character and the alternate character is appended to the list and prints the alternate characters.
  Example:
  enter first name: hemanth
  enter last name: kumar
  hemanth kumar
  hmnh kmr



  #program 2

  *In this program we first creates a file as input file and also we write the some words.
  *by using Read function we reads that input file and the words in that file.
  *Based on the loop it compares the every word in the file.
  *And it prints the output into the outputfile that which we want to create it before.
  *In the output file it prints as the word and how many times it repeats by using the write function.
  Example:
  python course
  Deep course
  Python-1
  Deep-1
  Course-2



  #program 3


  *In this program we take input from the user.
  *The input is heights of the persons in the inches.
  *The input integers are splits in to the list and they will be converted into centimeters.
  * 1inch=2.54cms
  * By the formula input heights that in inches will be converted into heights in centimeters.
    Example:
    heights in inches: `[150,155,140]
    heights in centimeters: [60.2, 46.8, 32.1]
